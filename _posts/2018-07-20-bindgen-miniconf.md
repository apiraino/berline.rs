It is time for another Rust meetup in Berlin!

This time we have a mini-conference around one topic: bindgen

The meetup will happen on **Wednesday, August 8th, 2018 19:00** 

We will meet in the beautiful [Mozilla Berlin Office](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4996803917) for a fresh round of talks, drinks, food and chatter about everyone's favorite programming language.


We're happy to announce 3 great speakers, each one covering one of the various bindgen tools out there:

## [Emilio Cobos √Ålvarez](https://github.com/emilio): rust-bindgen

[rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen) automatically generates Rust FFI bindings to C (and some C++) libraries.

## [Alexis Beingessner](https://github.com/Gankro): cbindgen

[cbindgen](https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen) can be used to generate C bindings for Rust code.

## [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams): wasm-bindgen

[wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) facilitates high-level interactions between wasm modules and JavaScript.

We're looking forward to see you there!
